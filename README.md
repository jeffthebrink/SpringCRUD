# SpringCRUD

### Description

The SpringCRUD assignment is just what it sounds like - a program written in Java using the Spring framework to exercise
Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions. The program "tracks" books as an example using a PostgreSQL database. 

Once the user has created their name and password, they may begin the CRUD process. All data is stored and manipulated using
Hibernate.
